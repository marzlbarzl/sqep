## Project description

This semester-long project focuses on the domain of speech quality assessment in telecommunications, aiming to implement ITU (International Telecommunication Union) standard listening tests. The objective is to design, develop, and deploy a software platform capable of conducting these tests in the lab to evaluate speech stimuli across multiple dimensions, including overall mean opinion score (MOS) and specific attributes such as noisiness, loudness, coloration, and discontinuity. 

## Project Objectives: 

Understand Speech Quality Assessment: Delve into the fundamentals of speech quality assessment, focusing on ITU standards for conducting listening tests. Software Platform Development: Design and create a comprehensive software platform that facilitates the execution of ITU standard listening tests. Documentation: Thoroughly document the platform to ensure future usability within the lab for subsequent experiments. Conduct Listening Tests: Utilize the developed platform to carry out experiments with provided speech stimuli, aiming to gather data on their quality across the perceptual dimensions. Data Collection and Analysis: Collect, analyze, and interpret the data from the listening tests, providing insights into speech quality assessment. Final Report: Compile a detailed project report, summarizing the methodology, development process, findings, and recommendations for future research and development. 

## Project Deliverables: 

Software Platform: A fully functional software platform for conducting ITU standard listening tests. User-friendly interface tailored for researchers and participants. Documentation: Comprehensive documentation covering the platform's design, development, and operation. Guidelines for conducting listening tests and analyzing results. Conducting the Experiment and Data Collection: Successful completion of listening tests (with human participants) with approximately 100 speech stimuli. Collection and preliminary analysis of data regarding speech quality dimensions. Final Report: An in-depth report documenting the project's scope, development process, results, and conclusions. Recommendations for future work and potential improvements to the platform.
